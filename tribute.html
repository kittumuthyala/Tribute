            <p>In 1948, Mother Teresa received a "call within a call" to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. She established the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, a religious congregation dedicated to serving "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."</p></center>
